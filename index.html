    <h2>Deciding My Path</h2>
    <p>Choosing a college course was a big decision for me, and I wanted something that fit my passion, my skills, and my future goals. My interest in technology started when I was young. I was always curious about gadgets and computers, not just for playing but for understanding how they worked.<br><br>
        Over time, I explored programming, websites, and cybersecurity, and I realized that technology is not just about convenience but about solving problems, connecting people, and protecting what’s important.</p>

    <h3>Why BSIT Feels Right for Me</h3>
    <p>That is why I chose BSIT. It offers hands-on learning in different areas like programming, networking, databases, and cybersecurity. I like how flexible it is, giving me the chance to explore and find my own path. I am especially drawn to cybersecurity, but I am excited to discover other fields too.</p>

        But beyond the career, what inspires me is the chance to make a difference through technology, whether by improving systems, creating solutions, or protecting people’s data.</p>

In the future, I hope to work in a company that values innovation and maybe even build my own tech business. More importantly, I want to keep learning because technology never stops evolving.</p>
